Seed project to create REST API using Jersey2 and Spring Framework.  This project uses spring annotations to configure spring beans and dependencies, spring data/jpa/hibernate for database entities, gradle as build management, and testng with hsqldb for testing.

This also comes with a gradle task to create unit test coverage for each subproject when gradle build or test is invoked.
